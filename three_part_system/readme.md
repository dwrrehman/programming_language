# A Compiler for A Programming Language


```
hello this is a test
for (nat i = 0; i < count; i++) {
	puts("hi lol");
}
```

we will be creating the syntax and specifications for the programming language now!

we will first start with making the `for` construct, which will begin using the following features:

- the first feature
- the second feature
- the third feature


and then we will do the next thing, which is the following


```
// this is a comment lol
function(bubbles, beans) {

	// the users code goes here!
}
```


and as you can see, its quite easy!
