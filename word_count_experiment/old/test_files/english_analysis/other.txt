uite simple



	the k >= 10 part         is the part that we are currently trying to reengineer  or somehow make different   in a way that doesnt suck and completely ruin the english sentence that it is part of lol 



			so yeah           basically to make code  in an english sentence       ableeee to be detected that it is there-



					but notttttt   make it obsiouvlyyyyy  there      just like     if you needed to know what the instrutions are, you can read them very simply from the english   by parsing it in a particular way 





		but like, for the most part, the way the language works shouldnt impact the english flow and explanation text at all 



					like, it should pretty muchhh just look like a regular english tb lololol 



			so yeah 



								hmmm 





			using word length and word count        allows us to do that        to a very high degree      which is greattt





		but what exact conditionnnnn          involving word length        triggers us to reset our count, and terminate that particular unary unmber that we are constructing 


						thats the missing part of this 



	hm
