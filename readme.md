# My Programming Language
 _The language with no syntax._
 Created By Daniel Rehman.

This programming language is a general-purpose, low-level, imperative and procedural, strongly, statically, nominally, and dependently typed, statically scoped, type-infered, compile-time interpreted and compiled systems programming language, designed with simplicity, minimalism, readability, and runtime performance in mind, and is built using the LLVM compiler infrastructure.

This project is an implementation written in C, and uses the LLVM C API. I intend to bootstrap the compiler once this temporary compiler is finished.
