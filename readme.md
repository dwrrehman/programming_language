# Untitled Programming Language

  _The language with no name or syntax._


This is a compiler for a general-purpose systems programming language.

	- It is imperative and procedural and compiled.

	- It is strongly, statically, nominally, and dependently typed.

	- It uses the LLVM compiler infrastructure, exclusively.


The language's priorities:

	- Brutal simplicity and minimalism: compiler's total source code is limited to 1000 lines.

	- Maximal runtime performance: faster than by-hand assembly

	- Code readability: There is no mandatory syntax in the language.


This project is an implementation written in C, and uses the LLVM C API. This compiler will be ised to bootstrap the real compiler once this one is finished.
