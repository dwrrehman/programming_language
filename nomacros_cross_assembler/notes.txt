	- we need to some how have a arithemteic way of going through the labels.  ie, 

		we need to essentiallyyyy expose the   ct dictionary  (ie, the whole dictionary) 

			at compiletime,  and be able to iterate through it programmatically. 


					additionally,   i feel like we should be able to   construct the notion of macros computationally  using the ct instructions!



	- we should also generate a list of ct/rt instructions,   ie, don't execute them in parsing. this allows for  eoi to happen reliably, 

		and also to seperate out strings from ct execution, which should help lol.

		note: i want to actually execute    ct and rt "at label"'s though? hmmm idk... 
						we'll see 



	- this rewrite will make things less string based,  (ct execution, specifically) 

		and also will make things more obvious how they translate:   critically just relying on  CT execution to do everything we want to do lol. 



	-  we should actually merge the notion of locations v.s. rt_locations.   those should be one idea. 

				possiblyyyyyy even merge the idea of  values and locations.   not sure on that one though. hmmm



					i feel like we literally never use the fact that   we can have the same label as variable name honestly.. we just don't.. hmmm




			so yeah we'll probably rip that feature out honestly lollll
