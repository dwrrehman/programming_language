GARBAGE FROM ASSEMBLER:
---------------------------






/*


1202405304.012527:


		next step is to add in the backend for riscv and arm64,

			the goal is to get everythinggg working with JUST the instructions:

				addi   sub   add 


		thats it   very simple langage     (oh and their compiletime versions,   and the core languaeg primitives like dup and swap etc)


				like, just those simple things- just getting those working-


				and then we can go through and add a ton of extra instructions and work on just getting branches working properly    as a seperate thing 


			but just getting the whole pipeline working,     just using    add  sub   addi 


						only 



			thats the goal.    very attainable.
