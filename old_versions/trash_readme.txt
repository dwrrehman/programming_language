----------------


the language's current isa consists of only branches, loads and stores, and the increment and set-zero operations, currently. this is subject to change. 

this language is still majorly a work in progress, and is going through a lot of developmental changes to do with how arguments are passed to instructions in the language. it should all be worked out fairly soon though (hopefully)
