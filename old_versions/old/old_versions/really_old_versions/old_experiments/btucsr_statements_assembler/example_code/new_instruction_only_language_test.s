	this file is basically trying to construct the compiletime system using only roughly 
	speaking the universe algorithm instruction set architecture. pretty cool!
	
	currently, all the base ct instructions have a c like spelling, just to make it easier for me to learn the languaeg,
		but that won't be the case in the actual language lol. just for testing and learning it right now.
