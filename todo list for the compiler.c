// this is basically the entire front end, EXECPT:

//   x  	1. we need to add type-strings, in artuments, and for prepended return types, in the context (seperated by space)

// 	2. we need to add   the define mode / intrinsic, of the algoirthm. where are NOT using the context to create the signatures. jus the file itself, basically. 

// 	3. as such, with #2, we need to catually have the escape characters we are going to use in order to make names:

// 		:      ;      (       )       bslsh        thats it          and possibly even less!  

//              :      ;      _       bslsh   

//      i think thats what we are going to have in order to make names builtin... i wish we could like configure this, or something... but its okay.... anyways. i think this will be good.

// 	4. finally, we also need to add the first couple of instructions we want to have:    also we need to add define, which takes a name, and also a value! then i think we are basically ready for code gen.
