	todo:  i have to look into  slightly revising the swap1 and 001 functionality... 


		one thing i did notice though, 

			is that this language DOES NOT USE "space case" as its standard formatting




			but actually uses       "nocase"          ie,   


	
					donothing         settozero          


				ie, its spacecase, where you dont put any spaces!


					i feel like nocase is the most readable. its also very neutral.




						i actually love it! its the simplest to use too!

								and can be pretty readable too!


								i love it. 













	 
	snake_case       <------- or this one when necc.

	
	SHOUT_CASE


	CamelCase


	Snake_Camel_Case



	space case



	nocase          <--------------- this is the right one. for the most part.
