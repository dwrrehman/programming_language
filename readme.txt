a compiler for a programming language
---------------------------------------

this is a language that is designed to be as simple as possible, without loosing any control on performance on the target architectures that it chooses to target. 

this language targets risc-v (32 bit and 64 bit) arm (32 bit and 64 bit) as well as possibly x86-64, in the future. the first two archs and their two subtypes are the main priorities in the language, however.

the language's current isa consists of only branches, loads and stores, and the increment and set-zero operations, currently. this is subject to change. 

this language is still majorly a work in progress, and is going through a lot of developmental changes to do with how arguments are passed to instructions in the language. it should all be worked out fairly soon though (hopefully)


hope you find it interesting!
