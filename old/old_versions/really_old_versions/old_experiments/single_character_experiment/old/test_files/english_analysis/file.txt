	so yeah. when you start a word, you need to like.. record the word length of the first word as well 



					and then except like... something related to that... hm.. 










		yeah, i feel like doing an analysis of the word lengths and their counts associated with them would be a good idea right about now lol.



lets do that on this very document, maybe lol. okay sure yeah lets try that lol.








gunna take the last few sentences and put it through a c program that ill write real quick to analyze the word lengths of each word in each sentence lol 



yay
