todo for the assembler

--------------------------------------------------



	- make "def" not be an instruction that defines something, but rather, attributes a  macro argument  such that it works like obs, but instead, of being optionally defined, it is actaully forcefully defined. 
	- and then, we have    


			def0 mymacro x y z
				def x            . this argument, (if defined already,  that previous refereence is ignored, and a new one is generated)
							is defined into the outter scope, newly. guaranteed. . 

				obs y            . this argument will be defined into the outter scope if it does not exist already, 
							but if one exists, the previous reference will just be used. (debatebly useful... hmmm)


						. z has not been attributed at all, and thus means that it actually 
							MUST be defined prior to entering the function body. .

				. body using x y and z here . 

				ret



	- add the msp430 backend

	- test the hello world program on arm64

	- get string tables working, and working with strings
