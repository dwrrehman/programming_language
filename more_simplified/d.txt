	todo:

	*****   - make working with mulitple files possible:   add a new built in word for using a word as a filename, and looking up it, and inserting its contents like a macro call.       

						oh wait, we can just use        external  is           ie, a macro call thats external?  no..


									is    is for definitions.   not calls. 

					lets make a new built in,     called               use 



								so, its appearance in code would be things like 


											foundation.txt use 
											mymodulefile.txt use 
											

	**	- make comments also strings! useful, for printing text. 
		
				add a new built-in word   for using the content of a macro body as a string. 

	*	- make the hello world program. 

	***	- make the execution mechanism use the correct instruction selection algorithm, not executing instructions directy!!!!
		
		- make a simple for loop macro, for an array of elements.
	
		- amke a while< loop macro

		- make a if< statement macro

		- figure out how to specify an array of elements, somehow!!! 


		- make constants not suck, by defining some hex constants, binary constants, and decimal groups numbers by 9 digits,

			so we can write     0x34         and        000 000 1         to mean  a million.
